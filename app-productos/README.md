# AppProductos

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.3.
Before installing Angular, we will install Node.js from the terminal using the following commands:

We need Node.js version 18, which can be downloaded from the following page: https://nodejs.org/en/download

bash

# Verify the Node.js version:
node -v # Should print "v18.20.7".

# Verify npm version:
npm -v # Should print "10.8.2".
Once installed, we will proceed to install Angular CLI:

bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install @angular/common/http
If you already have the repository cloned, simply navigate to the folder path. In this case, the project is called Fronted-Producto.

Once you are in the correct folder, run the following command:


## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
